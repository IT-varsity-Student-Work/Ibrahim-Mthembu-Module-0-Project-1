        <p>Paradise is a northeastern suburb of Adelaide in South Australia. It is bounded on the north side by the River Torrens. Amongst its neighboring suburbs are Highbury, Dernancourt, Athelstone, Newton and Campbelltown.

        Paradise is in the City of Campbelltown local government area. It was split across the South Australian House of Assembly electoral districts of Morialta (south-east part) and Hartley (north and west parts of Paradise) but has since all been incorporated into Hartley, and is in the Australian House of Representatives Division of Sturt.The suburb, originally "Shepley", was named "Paradise" by Joseph Ind, who had Balmoral orange orchard on the banks of the nearby Torrens River, and was taken from his "Paradise Bridge Hotel," named after a property called Paradise near his native Tetbury in Gloucestershire, England. He started the hotel in the front room of a cottage which he built in the nearby village of Paradise, which he established on land he gave to the community. The Ind Orchards were so productive and of such quality that the area was claimed to "truly be a paradise" for fruitThe topography of Paradise is mostly flat, with the river Torrens acting as the northern boundary.

        The site was the location of many market gardens during the 20th century and some of these still remain, as can be seen by contemporary satellite imagery. Housing now occupies much of the suburb.

        The suburb contains the Thorndon Park Reserve, formerly the site of Thorndon Park Reservoir, built in 1860 and the first reservoir in Adelaide's Metropolitan water supply. The reservoir was supplied by the River Torrens via an aqueduct..</p>
